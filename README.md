Third and final Game of Gamedev.tv course in c++ with Raylib. I hope to make more games and applications with cpp.

I made this game with the help of course from udemy added a new feature apart course i.e background music. Ost is from bastion - "in case of trouble" which is dmca free.

This games functikonality with pictures and videos is as follows: - 

Main character(mc) has a sword and tries to kill all monsters nearby with his sword. Sword can be used by clicking left mouse button. 
If all enemies are killed you win or if your health bar drops to zero you die and game will be over.
